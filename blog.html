		<h5>Command Line Fu</h5>
		<p>As a new arrival on the techscape today has abeen a whirlwind of acronyms, ideas, and keystrokes. The most fascinating thing to me as a new user is the command line. With a few well chosen commands and some usefull help pages I was able to begin to unveil the frighteningly massive amount of information behind the shiny buttons and helpful tooltips in the GUI. I am finding that the ability to find what I want and then interact directly with the machine to accomplish my task is incredibly helpful in the learning process. Many (ok, almost all) of the things I saw today don'tmake complete sense, but the concepts don't seem as vague, and I see now that I can unlock the mystery with some hard work. For now, if only this worked. <br/>~/sudo apt-get install all_the_answers<br/>-Brandon Brown</p>

		<h5>Booleans, Binary and bash</h5>
		<p>Today was much more of a nuts and bolts type of day which I like, but it does cause more brain pain. Working with if statements seems simple enough on the chalk board, but the execution is quite elusive. Learned quite a bit about lists, indexing and removing items from them, calling specific peices of them, and even storing dynamic variables in them. Work on creating the dice game has caused me to realized truly how little knowledge I posess, yet succeeding in the creation of a digital 6 sided dice gave me way more joy than I feel it should have. I'm surprised to learn I retained much of the information I learned yesterday, and dealing with the git bash terminal came much more easily to me. I still have some problems with my file structure and getting the proper repositories in the right spots, but I feel confident that given a week or two the clouds will start to break and I may be able to enjoy some lucidity when it comes to these concepts. <br/>-Brandon Brown <br/>-SudoPriest Acolyte</p>

		<h5>My life is a lie, code is truth.</h5>
		<p>The computer only does what you tell it to do. Sounds easy, but what happens when you have no idea what you told the damned thing to do. Or what if you told it to do one thing and it does another. What do you change? What do you keep? Today was an exercise in print commands. I have decided that, for now, there can never be too many print statements. Yes, it is cumbersome. Yes, #'s become very important. But I found that my understanding of what I was doing grew exponentially the more I painstakingly forced my code to tell me exactly what it was doing, and to write out the answers that it was recieving. I don't feel more confident in my ability to understand what I'm doing than I did yesterday. But I begin to see that I WILL understand it with more exposure. <br/>-Brandon Brown  <br/>:wq</p>

		<h5>Form and Function()</h5>
		<p>I wish I had more to say but I don't. Today I saw a function. I think I can see how it could be used. But I can't see much farther than that. Trying to actually put something useful on the screen today has been rather nightmareish. When I did actually start trying to write some code with functions, I couldn't help but feel that I was creating busy work for no real reason. My brain can't grasp the design concept well enough to plan out what functions I would need, and then also design the functions to interact correctly as I go along. As soon as I finished one, I realized i needed another one. Or, conversely, I would realize that I had made a useless or combersome function that had no place in the code. Frustrated and sleepy. <br/>Brandon Brown <br/>~/sudo shutdown -h now</p>

		<h5>This stuff is loopy</h5>
		<p>I am quite happy that it is friday. But maybe not for the reason that you think. After the onslought of information, nay the veritable deluge of data, I need some time to go through all the key words I have written down, the key concepts I have tucked away for future reference need to be referenced, and the trailing lines of my thought processes need to be solidified into actual knowledge I can do something with, rather than a string of copy paste commands that my brain can run. I am jazzed and invigorated, and I can't wait to learn more. If only my brain could keep up with my heart. I must content myself with the knowledge that I am making progress, and whether I feel that it is fast enough or not.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq</p>

		<h5>A day of win</h5>
		<p>Today was a day in which I allowed myself to just accept where I was at as for as learning was concerned, and it was a good decision. Despite my apparent lack of progress I discovered that the information was indeed slowly seeping into my skull. I wrote a piece of code to allow me to pick up a data stream from twitter, and it only took my two tries to get it to work. Thats a win. I also succeeded in wrapping my head more firmly around the design principles I have been struggling to learn, and subsequently the code has gone from a foreign language I've never seen before to a system that I can visualize, albeit not well or smoothly, but visualize none the less. I'm happy, I'm triumphant, I'm ready to learn more.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq</p>

		<h5>Patience is not my virtue</h5>
		<p>I have made a lot of great striding steps in my own personal developement in the last week. I have begun to learn a new written language, a new operating system, and I am implementing a new organizational tool for manageing my time and tasks. I've done really well, and can see improvement already. But for some reason it just isn't enough for me. I understand on the conceptual level that I should be ecstatic about my progress thus far, that I expect to improve too quickly. But the fact remains that it isn't good enough. The ideas don't present themselves to me. This stuff isn't even close to being intuitive to me, and because I take so long to solve the labs, my project falls behind. I feel worthless for spending time on lab, yet I can't justify doing my own research until the lab is finished, and now I stand at the end of the day with an incomplete lab and a piece of code that I didn't add one line to all day. I guess the only thing left to do is clear my head, and hope that after my brain cools off it's had a chance to process the question in a different way.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:q!</p>

		<h5>The turtle wins, but the penguin is supreme.</h5>
		<p>I spent a lot of time reading today. I began to realize that I have been in error in my thinking of late. I have been beating myself up because I haven't felt I've gotten enough words on the screen. I felt like I was spending to much time reading and not enough time doing. But I realized today that if I read with focus and clarity,(as opposed to speed and a manic need to find the answer im looking for), I remember and internalize a lot more. I need to slow down and let myself catch up. It was quite a revelation, almost as wonderful as seeing the actual proof that with enough time spent, progress quietly moves in, unassuming and low key. I wouldn't have even noticed it if I wasn't looking for something to write about. I still have a lot of work ahead of me this evening, but I have a clear vision, and that sets my mind at ease.</p>

		<h5>The first break down is communication.</h5>
		<p>I learned a lot in the past few days about working with a team. There are the obvious things like communication, (mentioned in the title), and cooperation. Enough has been said by many smarter people than I about those sorts of things, so I will let it be. It's the inobvious things that I wish to speak of. Things like design structure, team mentality and direction, standards that everyone can adhere to. Try group coding a python program, and every time you check something out from github it won't run because everyone but you is using tab. I try understanding a program that has been cobbled together from a grouping of poorly built functions that have been shoved into a class. Or try spending a day and a half working on a piece of functionality only to find out that we all missunderstood the requirements. Using source control at this point with the newness of all of the students here just makes trying to do anything a nightmare. Now to hopefully work on my sadly neglected personal project. <br/> -Brandon Brown</p>

		<h5>self.reflection()</h5>
		<p>This week has not been easy, but it has been good. I am sleep deprived, over stimulated, and fatigued, but I am invigorated. I didn't finish what I set out to do on monday, but I my progress was outstanding and rewarding. I experienced one of the greatest feelings in my life today. I am truly content for once in my life, and it spawned from such a simple thing: I gave it my all. There was nothing more to give. I don't think I have ever truly given my best effort to anything in my life. And even though I failed to complete some things, the knowledge that I put 100% of my effort into allows me to be satisfied with my effort. Even proud of it. This is a good day. <br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>Break</p>

		<h5>Gambling</h5>
		<p>I finally got the time to sit down and truly immerse myself in my code today. It was a great experience, but also an eye opening one. It was interesting how hard it was to get back in to the flow of the code and the mindset that I was in while writing. I found myself having to run and re-run through the program in order to have any idea what was going on, even though I was the one who wrote the thing in the first place. But I did find that the longer I spent working on it, the more the concepts reinforced themselves in my mind. This is frustrating because even though I truly desire to know these things right now, I know that there is no substitute for time. And that realization doesn't make me feel any better.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq</p>

		<h5>Snakes on a Plane</h5>
		<p>We finished the python core curriculum today, and I am happy to say that I am incredibly excited to keep learning python! Today I built a program that could listen to the twitter stream, and when it found a specific word inside a given tweet, would reply to that user with a tweet of my own. I also built a game that would allow the user to guess a number that the computer had picked, with only a higher or lower indicator after each input. I consistantly and diligently continued to build on my personal project, and I can feel the language and the mindset resolving itself in me. Tomorrow we begin our foray into JavaScript, and though it is unknown terratory, it is an adventure I can't wait to dive into... After I read some more about Python of course.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>Import This</p>

		<h5>Coming along</h5>
		<p>Today we got a crash course in HTML, and then spent the day trying to make a web page look like another webpage. I am frustrated by the fact that although I have followed the steps there is one thing that will not be fixed, no matter how much I fight with it. One thing I like about this new topic is I get an opportunity to see my changes as I make them, which reinforces the feeling that I am creating something tangible. Let us hope that this trend continues. I was also able to put some time into my online presence today, so don't forget to follow me on twitter. @sudopriest<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq</p>
