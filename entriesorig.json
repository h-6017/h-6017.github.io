		"text":"As a new arrival on the techscape today has abeen a whirlwind of acronyms, ideas, and keystrokes. The most fascinating thing to me as a new user is the command line. With a few well chosen commands and some usefull help pages I was able to begin to unveil the frighteningly massive amount of information behind the shiny buttons and helpful tooltips in the GUI. I am finding that the ability to find what I want and then interact directly with the machine to accomplish my task is incredibly helpful in the learning process. Many (ok, almost all) of the things I saw today don'tmake complete sense, but the concepts don't seem as vague, and I see now that I can unlock the mystery with some hard work. For now, if only this worked. <br/>~/sudo apt-get install all_the_answers<br/>-Brandon Brown"

		"text":"Today was much more of a nuts and bolts type of day which I like, but it does cause more brain pain. Working with if statements seems simple enough on the chalk board, but the execution is quite elusive. Learned quite a bit about lists, indexing and removing items from them, calling specific peices of them, and even storing dynamic variables in them. Work on creating the dice game has caused me to realized truly how little knowledge I posess, yet succeeding in the creation of a digital 6 sided dice gave me way more joy than I feel it should have. I'm surprised to learn I retained much of the information I learned yesterday, and dealing with the git bash terminal came much more easily to me. I still have some problems with my file structure and getting the proper repositories in the right spots, but I feel confident that given a week or two the clouds will start to break and I may be able to enjoy some lucidity when it comes to these concepts. <br/>-Brandon Brown <br/>-SudoPriest Acolyte"

		"text":"The computer only does what you tell it to do. Sounds easy, but what happens when you have no idea what you told the damned thing to do. Or what if you told it to do one thing and it does another. What do you change? What do you keep? Today was an exercise in print commands. I have decided that, for now, there can never be too many print statements. Yes, it is cumbersome. Yes, #'s become very important. But I found that my understanding of what I was doing grew exponentially the more I painstakingly forced my code to tell me exactly what it was doing, and to write out the answers that it was recieving. I don't feel more confident in my ability to understand what I'm doing than I did yesterday. But I begin to see that I WILL understand it with more exposure. <br/>-Brandon Brown  <br/>:wq"

Trying to actually put something useful on the screen today has been rather nightmareish. When I did actually start trying to write some code with functions, I couldn't help but feel that I was creating busy work for no real reason. My brain can't grasp the design concept well enough to plan out what functions I would need, and then also design the functions to interact correctly as I go along. As soon as I finished one, I realized i needed another one. Or, conversely, I would realize that I had made a useless or combersome function that had no place in the code.

After the onslought of information, nay the veritable deluge of data, I need some time to go through all the key words I have written down, the key concepts I have tucked away for future reference need to be referenced, and the trailing lines of my thought processes need to be solidified into actual knowledge I can do something with, rather than a string of copy paste commands that my brain can run. I am jazzed and invigorated, and I can't wait to learn more. If only my brain could keep up with my heart. I must content myself with the knowledge that I am making progress, and whether I feel that it is fast enough or not.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

		"text":"Today was a day in which I allowed myself to just accept where I was at as for as learning was concerned, and it was a good decision. Despite my apparent lack of progress I discovered that the information was indeed slowly seeping into my skull. I wrote a piece of code to allow me to pick up a data stream from twitter, and it only took my two tries to get it to work. Thats a win. I also succeeded in wrapping my head more firmly around the design principles I have been struggling to learn, and subsequently the code has gone from a foreign language I've never seen before to a system that I can visualize, albeit not well or smoothly, but visualize none the less. I'm happy, I'm triumphant, I'm ready to learn more.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

		"text":"I have made a lot of great striding steps in my own personal developement in the last week. I have begun to learn a new written language, a new operating system, and I am implementing a new organizational tool for manageing my time and tasks. I've done really well, and can see improvement already. But for some reason it just isn't enough for me. I understand on the conceptual level that I should be ecstatic about my progress thus far, that I expect to improve too quickly. But the fact remains that it isn't good enough. The ideas don't present themselves to me. This stuff isn't even close to being intuitive to me, and because I take so long to solve the labs, my project falls behind. I feel worthless for spending time on lab, yet I can't justify doing my own research until the lab is finished, and now I stand at the end of the day with an incomplete lab and a piece of code that I didn't add one line to all day. I guess the only thing left to do is clear my head, and hope that after my brain cools off it's had a chance to process the question in a different way.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:q!"

		"text":"I spent a lot of time reading today. I began to realize that I have been in error in my thinking of late. I have been beating myself up because I haven't felt I've gotten enough words on the screen. I felt like I was spending to much time reading and not enough time doing. But I realized today that if I read with focus and clarity,(as opposed to speed and a manic need to find the answer im looking for), I remember and internalize a lot more. I need to slow down and let myself catch up. It was quite a revelation, almost as wonderful as seeing the actual proof that with enough time spent, progress quietly moves in, unassuming and low key. I wouldn't have even noticed it if I wasn't looking for something to write about. I still have a lot of work ahead of me this evening, but I have a clear vision, and that sets my mind at ease."

		"text":"I learned a lot in the past few days about working with a team. There are the obvious things like communication, (mentioned in the title), and cooperation. Enough has been said by many smarter people than I about those sorts of things, so I will let it be. It's the inobvious things that I wish to speak of. Things like design structure, team mentality and direction, standards that everyone can adhere to. Try group coding a python program, and every time you check something out from github it won't run because everyone but you is using tab. I try understanding a program that has been cobbled together from a grouping of poorly built functions that have been shoved into a class. Or try spending a day and a half working on a piece of functionality only to find out that we all missunderstood the requirements. Using source control at this point with the newness of all of the students here just makes trying to do anything a nightmare. Now to hopefully work on my sadly neglected personal project. <br/> -Brandon Brown"

I didn't finish what I set out to do on monday, but I my progress was outstanding and rewarding. I experienced one of the greatest feelings in my life today. I am truly content for once in my life, and it spawned from such a simple thing: I gave it my all. There was nothing more to give. I don't think I have ever truly given my best effort to anything in my life. And even though I failed to complete some things, the knowledge that I put 100% of my effort into allows me to be satisfied with my effort. Even proud of it.

		"text":"I finally got the time to sit down and truly immerse myself in my code today. It was a great experience, but also an eye opening one. It was interesting how hard it was to get back in to the flow of the code and the mindset that I was in while writing. I found myself having to run and re-run through the program in order to have any idea what was going on, even though I was the one who wrote the thing in the first place. But I did find that the longer I spent working on it, the more the concepts reinforced themselves in my mind. This is frustrating because even though I truly desire to know these things right now, I know that there is no substitute for time.

Today I built a program that could listen to the twitter stream, and when it found a specific word inside a given tweet, would reply to that user with a tweet of my own. I also built a game that would allow the user to guess a number that the computer had picked, with only a higher or lower indicator after each input. I consistantly and diligently continued to build on my personal project, and I can feel the language and the mindset resolving itself in me. Tomorrow we begin our foray into JavaScript, and though it is unknown terratory, it is an adventure I can't wait to dive into...

I am frustrated by the fact that although I have followed the steps there is one thing that will not be fixed, no matter how much I fight with it. One thing I like about this new topic is I get an opportunity to see my changes as I make them, which reinforces the feeling that I am creating something tangible. Let us hope that this trend continues. I was also able to put some time into my online presence today, so don't forget to follow me on twitter. @sudopriest<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

		"text":"Today was all about JavaScript, and an interesting day it has been. Having a little bit of foundation in Python and the 'principles of programming' made learning the new syntax fairly easy, and the primer on html and css from yesterday was invaluable in giving me context in which to think about what I was doing with JavaScript. Both good things, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm sick of {}'s and ;'s. I was surprised at the speed with which I picked up the basic operations, such as for and while loops, if and switch statements and declaring variables and objects, but am disappointed to find that in order to get things done there is still alot of slow, meticulous reading and fiddling about(who knew?). I am getting the hang of the learning process though and consequently I can focus more and more clearly.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

The lab on using the Date() object in JavaScript that gave me so much trouble yesterday was much easier to understand with a fresh mind this morning. And the various exercises and coding challenges were easy to break down and think out. I may actually have begun to think like a developer in some deep part of my brain. Most of the work today had to do with using loops to parse through multidimensional arrays, and after a little experimentation I was able to wrap my brain around the concepts fairly quickly. More and more I am realizing the value of trying things out. If it makes sense to you that it should work a specific way, then code it that way and see why it breaks, fix what you think is wrong and try it again. Rinse, Repeat. It sounds tedious, and to an extent it is. But I've found that the more I force myself to go through it, the less I have to fiddle around on the next problem I encounter. For now I'm happy with my progress this week, I'm happy that it is friday, and I'm excited to work on my own projects this week.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

Google search, try potential solution, google search, try potential solution number 2... and so on. I worked on sourcing a .js file from an Html file, and calling javascript functions from an Html file. The understanding of what is actually going on is still elusive, but I made some things happen, which is cool. Each triumph is quickly overshadowed by the next problem, however, and overall it has been a rather slow day. The only other thing worth bringing attention to is the fact that I hate when I can't tell why what I coded is doing something I don't want it to do.<br/>-Brandon Brown<br/>:wq"

Today was all about using jquery to validate certain inputs from the user. We created some basic input tags designed to take in a string, and then created functions in a separate .js file to grab the values from those inputs and decide whether or not the input was correctly formatted or do some other action with the input we receive.

		"text":"My name is Brandon Brown, and I am a junior software developer at devCodeCamp in Waukesha, WI. I am familiar with Python  and JavaScript/jQuery. I have used the twitter api with python to create a basic twitter bot to find and reply to certain messages people send, and also with a team to extrapolate trending topics based on messages we received from a couple different locations in the U.S. I was responsible for implementing the code that allowed us to stream the data, and also worked with MongoDB in order to pick out certain pieces of the data we wanted to extrapolate from. As a security guard I learned to interact with many different kinds of people, and how to work independently to accomplish tasks. I have also trained in, and taught, martial arts for the last 14 years, which has given me alot of insight into the learning process, and helped me to learn how to formulate ideas and concepts into their tangible, practical application. Combine these traits with a teachable spirit, a passion for learning new things and developing myself, and an outgoing personality, I feel that I would be a perfect fit for your organization.

I have spent much of the day trying to create a form on  a webpage that could take in amounts of material (brick, wood, concrete, etc.) and use this information to auto display the total cost of the combined materials, and the square footage we could achieve with the given amount of materials based on an equation given to us with the materials required for one square foot of house. The coding part wasn't the issue, it was the math. I couldn't wrap my head around it at all. And spent most of the day in a fog of malcontent and hazy confusion.

		"text":"I learned a lot of interesting things today about using the resources available to me. In Chrome, it is possible to see the html code of the elements on the page, and this is an incredibly useful tool. If at any point your not sure why something is acting the way it is, it's as easy as right clicking the element to find out why. Now you may not be able to find the underlying problem as easy as that, but it gives you a solid starting point. The other interesting thing is the power of using jQuery in your browser to affect the landscape of the html page in real time. It doesn't change the actual source code, but it's great for testing certain things and seeing how they will look before you hard code them. I was able to finish the pagination of my blog posts using this technique and it made the whole machine make a lot more sense to me. I can't wait to keep working on this blog, it's great to have a tangible representation of my efforts.<br>-Brandon Brown<br>:wq"

I also set up a local web server to test and build my personal project in, and made great strides in learning about the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, and even put some code together that worked! (Granted it only worked after it was pointed out to me that I had used the British spelling for one of my variable names) But even that cannot dampen my mood.

Today was a huge mix of great moments and grinding halts, but at every turn a small cog would make a tiny bit more sense than it did the last time I saw it. I worked almost exlusively on my xmpp client today, and while it is live and running, it still doesn't do anything. I made monumental strides in my personal development, but just like yesterday, it's still not fast enough. I will very likely not have a minimum viable product by the end of the day tomorrow, but I can take a lot of pride that I am learning hard concepts, and learning to apply them in a very real way.

My stress level for the past week(while not pleasant) was highly effective in preparing me to give a talk on my peice of software. The fact that I have spent so much time in the code made it easy to find certain functions that were relevant very quickly. And forcing myself to understand the program better over the sleep-deprived weekend translated into a suprisingly cogent little walkthrough. After this exercise we were introduced to Visual Studio today, which is an IDE(Interactive Development Environment) based on the .NET framework. We are going to be using Visual Studio to creat c# applications, and today was mostly spent getting comfortable with the program, which seems quite powerful. It does give you a TON of shortcuts and allows you to use the GUI to generate code that matches the desired effect ie. dragging a button object from your toolbox and dropping it into your application will generate a new button function in your code that you can easily modify by double clicking the button you just created. It is nice to know that we will be sticking to one language for a while, and may actually have a little more time to explore what can be done with it.<br>-Brandon Brown<br>:wq"

Spent a lot of time dealing with variable declaration, type casting, and string formatting. It is kinda cool that c# on top of .NET has so many diagnostic options hardcoded into the language, and Visual Studio makes it really easy to fake it if you don't exactly know how to move on, just start with the variable you want to manipulate(which was granted a type on instantiation) and adding a period on the end will net you a wonderful dropdown menu of all the operations that can be performed on that particular object type. Can't perform the action you need? Well that probably means you are going to have to cast your variable into the type that will allow your desired operation to be performed. Confused? Me too. Moving from a loosely typed language to a strongly typed language certainly complicates things a bit. But as it is an industry standard, I suppose we must all give the devil his due. I am excited to start learning some solid desktop application design, heres to hoping we get to that sooner rather than later.<br>-Brandon Brown<br>:wq"
